# Bay Delta Water *bay-delta-water*

Furthering the discussion of accurately predicting water use in California's Bay Delta.

This is just an initial repository to maintain some of the current discussions regarding the requirements to upgrade
the accuracy of water use prediction for the Bay Delta.  At issue are the potential need of more CIMIS weather stations, better wind predictions, the incorporation of sophisticated weather prediction models; historically accurate high resolution land cover maps, and other data required to accurately model the Bay Delta's water use.

# GIS Data 

There are a number of GIS data sources available.  They exist both in a geojson format, shapefile, and KML formats.  Links to existing Google Fusion tables and MapsEngine configurations are also included.  The GIS data includes boundary information, and potential weather stations.
